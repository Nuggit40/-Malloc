Workload D will attempt to malloc more bytes than allowed. We decided to include this workload to demonstrate that the mymalloc will not allow the allocation of memory outside the alloted ammount.

Workload E will attempt to malloc 0 free when there are no bytes malloced. It will return NULL and give an error when attempting to free. We chose to include this workload to demostrate that malloc 0 returns null and that free can not be used when there are no bytes to be freed.
